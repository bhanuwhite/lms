Hello Good Evening Sir,


Today's Work:

1) Today as I was going deeper into the concepts of Node.Js I found some JavaScripts topics which we really need to be good at, like
	
	a) Lexical Structure
	b) Expressions
	c) Data Types
	d) Classes
	e) Variables
	f) Functions
	g) this operator
	h) Arrow Functions
	i) Loops
	j) Scopes
	k) Arrays
	l) Template Literals
	m) Strict Mode
	n) ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
	
	I just took a reference to see if I'm okay with these topics.


	These above Asynchronous programming topics I have to go through a bit.
	
	a) Asynchronous programming and callbacks
	b) Timers
	c) Promises	
	d) Async and Await	
	e) Closures	
	f) The Event Loop


2) I was following the official documentation of Node.Js (https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/) to get the concepts more clear.  



Thanks and regards 
Shubham Kumar Das

Today's Work

Today I ran a code on NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB to add data into the database
Faced a lot of error since mainly 'StrictQuery' and 'triggerUncaughtException' on the mongodb side.,
Which at the end was able to handle and got the desired result and added data to the database.,

Good Evening sir

Today's Work

Today I worked on Json Web Token (JWT) to store the token in cookies,
So that whenever we login cookies matches the stored token with newly built tokens,

I wrote code on Json Web Token and did the authorization and got the desired result,

Also I got the connection using MongoDB Atlas and was able to connect with the mongoDB using mongoose and displayed the data in the database.
Using Cluster under the collections : "test.users" and 

Used the functionality of JWT of jwt.sign(_id,) and jwt.verify().,
The use of jwt.sign({_id:object},(string:secretKey);
and the use to verify using jwt.verify(obj);

Also read the documentaion of Joi which will help in making schema's for validation purpose.


Tomorrow's Work

Tomorrow I will be constructing a singup and login page, and will validate the authentication and authorization through middlewares.,
Using tokens stored in cookies. 




Sincerely,
Shubham Kumar Das
